# GreedyNAR
Greedy nonlinear autoregression for multifidelity modeling.

This repository provides a modification of the nonlinear autoregression method for a model sequential construction based on greedy approaches. It also provides the stochastic collocation method for multifidelity modeling and Gaussian process with sequential learning for comparison.

Please refer Demo_synthe_01.m and Demo_synthe_02.m for the usage of the code. Please add all subfolder to your path to start using the code.



The following figures (generated by running Demo_synthe_02.m) show the performance of greedyNAR and stochastic collocation for synthetic three-fidelity data.
